        <h1>Challenges and Learning encountered during the development</h1>
        <p>I am a career shifter, 20 years of my career is at Human Resources. I even claim before that I am
            not a techy person, but, ccchhharrraaa!!! I can do magic now!
            <br>
            I am proud of this project, this is definitely my work, unlike when I was in the bootcamp where I 
            end up copying codes just to comply with the timeline. I believe I can make progress from this and develop
            more projects.
            <br>
            During the development I learned a lot of important things that I believe should be a foundation of any 
            developer. I listed here those AHA!!! moments.
        </p>
        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <h4>DOM Manipulation</h4>
        <p>Deeply understanding the tree made me realize how easy it is to traverse the DOM; to manipulate every element in HTML.
            At first I was very confused on how to manipulate object especially thru its index, but when I learned the OBJECT and the array,
            I am now confident that I can make magic out of codes.
        </p>
        <h4>JQuery</h4>
        <p>I used Jquery to showcase the animation on my project. I believe it is petty but I am just starting. I will continuously hone
            my skills with more projects to come.
        </p>
        <h4>Javascript Array Function</h4>
        <p>I learned a lot of array method during this project. By continuously reading documents at W3Schools and watching tutorials at youtube,
            I was able to learn how to efficiently use filter, indexOf, forEach, for loop methods. It was tempting to just copy codes from
            tutorials, but I believe by understanding the codes you can deliver better. 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Debugging</h2>
        <p> During the development stage I was able to encounter challenges, it might be simple for others, 
            but for a beginner like me I feel satisfaction after being able to address the challenges.</p>
        <h4>Recursive Function</h4>
        <p> On my Jquery functions which I used a lot on my introductory page, I learned that it is very important
            to end a function that could repeatedly call itself, thus recursion occurs. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I did not talk about styling and how I made my project reponsive but theres a lot I learned from that too.</p>
